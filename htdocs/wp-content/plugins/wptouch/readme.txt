WPtouch automatically transforms your WordPress blog into an iPhone application-style theme, complete with ajax loading articles and effects, when viewed from an iPhone, iPod touch, Android, Opera Mini, Palm Pre and BlackBerry Storm mobile devices.

== Description ==

With a single click, *WPtouch* transforms your WordPress blog into an iPhone application-style theme, complete with ajax loading articles and effects, when viewed from an iPhone, iPod touch, Android or BlackBerry touch mobile device.

The admin panel allows you to customize many aspects of its appearance, and deliver a fast, user-friendly and stylish version of your site to your iPhone, iPod touch, Android, Opera Mini mobile, Palm Pre and BlackBerry Storm visitors without modifying a single bit of code (or affecting) your regular desktop theme.

The theme also includes the ability for your visitors to easily switch between the *WPtouch* view and your site's regular theme.

== Installation ==

= 2.6 and Older =
Sorry, we do not officially support installations on WordPress 2.6 or older. You can use WPtouch 1.9.3.4 or older on these installations, however.

= 2.7, 2.8+ =
You can install *WPtouch* directly from the WordPress admin! Visit the *Plugins/Add New* page and search for 'WPtouch'. Click to install.

Once installed and activated visit the WPtouch admin page (*Settings/WPtouch*) to customize your WPtouch appearance.

= WordPress MU =

The best way to use WPtouch on WordPress MU is to do so via the "Activate WPtouch iPhone Theme Site Wide" link in the plugins area.

* Install WPtouch, either manually or via the "Add New" option in the plugins menu
* Ensure that you have site wide plugins enabled in the Site Admin / Options menu
* On the plugin configuration page activate WPtouch as a site wide plugin by clicking the "Activate WPtouch iPhone Theme Site Wide" link.  If WPtouch is already activated, deactivate it first.

You can also checkout our Support Forums at http://support.bravenewcode.com to post questions and learn tips and tricks for *WPtouch* and our other plugins.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I thought the iPhone/iPod touch/Pre/Storm/Android shows my website fine the way it is now? =

Yes, that's true for the most part. However, not all websites are created equal, with some sites failing to translate well in the viewport of a small mobile device. Many WordPress sites today make heavy use of different javascript files which significantly increase the load time of pages, and drive your visitors on 3G/EDGE batty. So we've come up with *WPtouch*, a lightweight, fast-loading, feature-rich and highly-customized "theme application" which includes an admin interface to let you customize many aspects of your site's presentation.

= Well, what if my users don't like it and want to see my regular site? =

There's a mobile switch option in the footer on *WPtouch* for your users with browsers that support cookies to easily switch between the *WPtouch* view and your site's regular appearance. It's that easy. We even automatically put a little snippet of code into your current theme which will be shown only to iPhone, iPod touch, Android or BlackBerry touch mobile device visitors, giving them control to switch between the two site themes easily.

= Will it slow down my blog, or increase my server load? =

Not bloody likely! Unless of course you're getting slammed with all sorts of traffic because you've installed this sexy plugin. The entire theme files footprint for *WPtouch* is small. It was designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your site's content in a richly presented way, sparing no essential features like search, login, categories, tags, comments etc.
