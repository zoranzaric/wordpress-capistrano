Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 2.9.X

Allows WordPress Admins to show only a selected few categories on the sidebar and hide the rest from view until visitor clicks "See All".  Useful for sites that have lots of categories.

== Description ==

Do you have a lot of categories and sick of having a huge list in your archives?  Want to highlight only a few of them to make your site easier to navigate?

While redesigning WordPress sites for our clients we kept running into this problem over and over.  They had a huge list of legacy categories but only needed/wanted to highlight a few of them.  So we wrote this plugin to allow them to select which categories to show and which categories to initially hide.

All categories are still accessible by a "see all" link at the bottom of the list.

== Installation ==

Upload the Category Expander plugin to your blog, Activate it, then update your settings.
