This project is an attempt to have the latest and greatest version of Wordpress, available for a multi stage deploy
using Ruby's Capistrano utility. 

A fresh clone of this repository will give you the latest version of Wordpress, with the following essential plugins

1. Google XML Sitemaps
2. All-in-one SEO Pack
3. Google Analytics
4. GetClicky 


To start with you'll need to configure the db in each environment manually, but the goal is to have such configuration
take place via capistrano.
